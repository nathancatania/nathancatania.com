DEPRECIATED - May 2020.

Moved website to Hugo + Netlify (repo located [here](https://github.com/nathancatania/website)).
This version used Jekyll + GitHub Pages.

---

This is the repository that runs my personal website using [Jekyll][1] and [GitHub Pages][2].

The theme is a modified version of the [Chalk][3] theme.
